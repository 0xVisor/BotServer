# BotServer
BotServer is an modified GrowtopiaBot that is being used to overload Growtopia Private Server until it reaches it max quantity
## How it Works?
Basically, there's a thousand of bot, replicating itseld and log into the requested server, after it log on, it'll then extend and overloading the server until the server cannot handle the packets.
## Configuration File
Create a file called "bot.json" and place it in the same folder as the program is in.
```json
{
  "username": "RaidedByArtemis",
  "password": "gay",
  "gameVersion": "3.84",
  "targetWorld": "START",
  "ownerUsername": "test",
  "bot_meta": "localhost",
  "server_host": "",
  "server_port": 17095
}
